# Peaceful Science Documents

This public repository houses documents issued by [Peaceful Science](https://peacefulscience.org). The repository includes a complete history of revisions for each document, and the current versions are published on our main website.

We welcome comments and suggestions on how to improve these documents. Please submit an "issue" to this github repository if you have a suggestion. To suggest specific edits:

1. Find the document you want to edit in this repository.

2. Click the pen icon in the upper right to open the editor.
3. Documents are in markdown format, which you can learn about [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
4. Submit the changes for review by clicking "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." at the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, if you have more technical expertise, this might be easier:

1. "Fork" this repository.

2. Edit the document as you reccomend, which is possible directly in github. Documents are in markdown format.
3. Make a "pull request" for us to consider.


There are excellent tutorials online on how to do this, and it does not require any coding or special software. All steps can be accomplished in a browser, at this webstie. Of course, if this process is too confusing, we still welcome your feedback, and encourage you to email us or contact us on the [forum](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org).
